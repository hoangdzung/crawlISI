Abstract
This paper presents an on-line energy management strategy (EMS) based on trip condition prediction for commuter plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (P-HEVs). The purpose is to provide an on-line predictive control approach to minimize fuel consumption. Two pivotal contributions are provided to realize the purpose. First of all, we establish the trip condition prediction model by using back propagation neural network, to obtain the real-time vehicle-speed trajectory on-line. Particularly, both the genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization algorithm are applied to improve the prediction accuracy of the trip condition prediction model. Next, to obtain an applicable EMS in real time, we propose a dynamic programming-based predictive control strategy. Finally, a simulation study is conducted for applying the proposed strategy to a practical trip path in the Beijing road network. The results show that the designed trip condition prediction model can effectively realize the on-line vehicle-speed prediction, and the prediction accuracy is more than 93%. In addition, compared to the offline global optimization EMS, although the proposed strategy makes the fuel consumption grow less than 5.2%, it can be implemented in real time. Moreover, compared with the existing real-time EMSs, it can further reduce the fuel consumption and emissions. It shows that the proposed EMS can provide an effective solution for commuter P-HEVs applying it on-line.
