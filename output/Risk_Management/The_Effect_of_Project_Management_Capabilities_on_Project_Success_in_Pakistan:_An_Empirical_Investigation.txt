Abstract
Project management maturity (PMM) is gaining interest from different domains of research because it can be used to assess the strengths and weaknesses of ongoing projects within organizations. Thus, this paper aims to present and validate a research model that includes PMM and project success. Partial least squares' structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) is used to assess the research model. The suggested hypotheses were tested based on a sample of 425 respondents from project-based organizations in Pakistan. The findings of the study indicate that there is a positive relationship between PMM and project success. Moreover, it was inferred from the results that different dimensions of PMM such as knowledge management transfer, process management, and resource project management could directly influence project success. However, it is also determined in this study that the use of software, continuous improvement, and training did not significantly affect the success of projects in Pakistan.
