Abstract
Vascular malformations are a very heterogeneous group of circulatory system's diseases, that can involve different kind of vessels: arterial, venous or lymphatic ones.

Many treatments, such as conventional surgery, embolization, steroid therapy and laser therapy, are available for vascular lesions.

The laser approach relies more therapeutic techniques: the transmucosal thermophotocoagulation, intralesional photocoagulation, the excisional biopsy.

Today laser is demonstrated to be the gold standard technique to treat vascular lesions that allows a safe and efficient treatment and a lower post-operative healing time. The only disadvantage is the risk of carbonization that could be avoided by using the multiple-spot single pulsed wave technique.
