Abstract
This paper is devoted to the development of scientific and methodological foundations of improvement the information support of decision at management of power network with distributed generation. It is proposed to consider the power quality index as the main criterion of management. Using the theory of fuzzy sets, the assessment of the conformity of power quality indicators to electric energy quality limits is done. A method for estimating the quality of electrical energy is proposed which represents the measured histogram as a fuzzy representation indicator of quality of electric energy in the form of fuzzy sets with a step membership function. The method of integral evaluation of electrical energy quality for different types of load is developed. The presented method allows to formulate rules for managing the operating modes of the distributed electrical network by the decision support system.
