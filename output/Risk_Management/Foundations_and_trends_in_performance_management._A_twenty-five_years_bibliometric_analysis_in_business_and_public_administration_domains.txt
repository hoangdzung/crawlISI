Abstract
Our paper analyses 25 years of performance management research published in the English-language journals, included in SSCI database, separating the business domain from public sector one. We used a content analysis for showing the relationships between the subfields of performance management and the time evolution. Through a multiple correspondence analysis based on keywords we provide a framework to track this literature over the 25-year period. We conclude the paper with a discussion on future pathways in the performance management literature.
