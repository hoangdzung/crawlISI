Abstract
The development of software across different countries (and time zones) differs substantially from software development in one single country or region. The management of processes and people, who work in globally distributed teams, requires a high level of coordination and collaboration which needs to be based on established human resource management practices. The People Capability Maturity Model (People-CMM) provides a complete framework that enables quality in human resource management to be improved. However, today, the adoption of the People-CMM within organizations using Global Software Development (GSD) is not an easy task. This paper uses an empirical study to analyze the implementation of the People-CMM within the GSD context. Results confirm that cultural and communication problems are the main challenges in the implementation of the People-CMM adoption within GSD scenarios.
