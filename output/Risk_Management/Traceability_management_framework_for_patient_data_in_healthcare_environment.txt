Abstract
Change management or configuration management is becoming necessity for every facet of software system development. Traceability of objects i.e. artifacts or information units becomes core talent for authentic determination of the parametric information over the explicit instance of time. This paper presents the evolving and useful concept of traceability management wrapped in change management paradigm that provides perception for requirement analysis phase. We have analyzed the patient data requirements workflow model with respect to the traceability management process. We have proposed a new approach for better traceability of patient data management model (PDMM) for identification and realization of trace relationships within requirements (IRTRR) in healthcare environment. We have named the model as PDMM-IRTRR framework. The key activities represented in the proposed framework are also highlighted.
